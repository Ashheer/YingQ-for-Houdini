@parameters

Group:
    #id: group
    Subset of geometry to subdivide.

Group Type:
    #id: grouptype
    The type of entities in the group.

Algorithm:
    #id: algorithm
    Subdivision algorithm used.
    
    Improved OpenSubdiv Catmull-Clark:
        Uses a modified OpenSubdiv Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm.
    
    Improved OpenSubdiv Bilinear:
        Uses a modified OpenSubdiv Bilinear subdivision algorithm to perform bilinear refinement (with no blending of vertices).

Smooth Borders:
    #id: smoothborders
    When using the OpenSubdiv Catmull-Clark subdivision algorithm, allows you to keep borders as is (on), or if turned off, uses OpenSubdiv Bilinear subdivision algorithm for the borders.
        
Iterations:
    #id: iterations
    How many iterations to subdivide, higher numbers give a smoother surface.

Radius:
    #id: r
    Initial radius used for the first iteration of proximity look ups.
    
Radius Multiplier:
    #id: multiplier
    Multiplies the radius by this number after each subdivision level.

Override Crease Weight Attribute:
    #id: overridecrease
    Determine if the crease sharpness should be determined by the primitive or vertex creaseweight attribute or by overridden by this operation.

Crease Weight:
    #id: creaseweight
    If the crease weight is overridden, this is the weight used.

Visualize:
    #id: visualize
    Visualizes each subdivision level using different colors.

Seed:
    #id: seed
    Seed used for coloring each subdivision level.
    
Show Guide:
    #id: guide
    Shows the initial radius used by the proximity geometry.
